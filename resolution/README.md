# EIC_chadron

## Generator level

## Fast simulation
* `fastsim.h`: contains all the smearing parameters for momentum, vertex position and particle identification (PID)
* `D0_tree_patch.C`: contains `D0_reco` and `Lc_reco`. This code takes in the generated events in `EICTree` format and write out histograms related to reconstructed charm hadron study
* `plot_decay_kin.C`: plotting decay particle kinematics
