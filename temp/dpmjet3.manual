                            INPUT OPTIONS
                           _______________


 The input of DPMJET consists of option cards. Option cards have all the
 same structure and have to be given in fixed format except for the
 section enclosed by PHOINPUT and ENDINPUT which can be given in free format.

      CODEWD, (WHAT(I),I=1,6), SDUM   (default fixed format is
                                       A10,6E10.0,A8)

   where:

   - CODEWD is the option keyword
   - The WHAT-parameters are numerical data
   - SDUM may contain literal data

 The order of the input cards is free, with the exception of the START card
 which initiates event generation and the BEAM card (see below).

 Most definitions have some default values. If these are acceptable,
 it is not compulsory that the corresponding option card appear
 explicitly in the input sequence. Similarly, for most WHAT and/or SDUM
 parameters a default value is applied if the corresponding field is left 
 blank (or set = 0.0) in the input card.

 Several option cards may appear more than once in the input sequence.
 In most cases, each of such additional cards obviously adds more
 definitions to those already given, provided they are different and not
 contradictory. In case of conflict, the last given generally overrides
 the previous one(s).

 Any line starting with "*" is treated as a comment line.

                     EVENT HISTORY - COMMON /DTEVT1/
                    _________________________________


 1) Common block DTEVT1
 ----------------------

 The complete history of each event can be found in COMMON /DTEVT1/ 
 and COMMON /EXTEVT/.

 COMMON /DTEVT1/ :
         NHKK         number of entries in common block
         NEVHKK       number of the event
         ISTHKK(i)    status code for entry i
         IDHKK(i)     identifier for the entry
                      (for particles: identifier according to the PDG scheme)
         JMOHKK(1,i)  pointer to the entry of the first mother of entry i
         JMOHKK(2,i)  pointer to the entry of the second mother of entry i
         JDAHKK(1,i)  pointer to the entry of the first daughter of entry i
         JDAHKK(2,i)  pointer to the entry of the second daughter of entry i
         PHKK(1..3,i) 3-momentum
         PHKK(4,i)    energy
         PHKK(5,i)    mass
         VHKK / WHKK  spatial position of particle in target / projectile
                      rest frame

 2) Final state particles
 ------------------------

 The final state particles from the actual event (number NEVHKK)
 can be found in DTEVT1 and identified by their status:

    ISTHKK(i) = 1    final state particle produced in
                     photon-/hadron-/nucleon-nucleon collisions or
                     in intranuclear cascade processes
               -1    nucleons, deuterons, H-3, He-3, He-4 evaporated
                     from excited nucleus, fragmentation and fission
                     products (A > 4) and photons produced in nuclear 
                     deexcitation processes
               1001  residual nucleus (ground state)

 The types of these particles/nuclei are given in IDHKK as follows

    all final state particles except nuclei :
      IDHKK(i)=particle identifier according to PDG numbering scheme
    nuclei (A > 1: evaporation / fragmentation / fission products, and 
            residual nuclei) :
      IDHKK(i)=80000, IDRES(i)=mass number, IDXRES(i)=charge number

 The 4-momenta and masses can be found in PHKK (target nucleus rest frame
 unless defined by the FRAME-card):
                  PHKK(1..3,i) 3-momentum (p_x,p_y,p_z)
                  PHKK(4,i)    energy
                  PHKK(5,i)    mass
