When running PYTHIA model, the event structure goes as follows:


The output file text format has the following structure:

1st line: "PYTHIA EVENT FILE"
2nd line: "============================================"
3rd line: Information on event wise variables stored in the file 

I: 	0 (line index)
ievent: 	eventnumber running from 1 to XXX
genevent: 	trials to generate this event
subprocess: 	pythia subprocess (MSTI(1)), for details see table above
nucleon: 	hadron beam type (MSTI(12))
targetparton: 	parton hit in the target (MSTI(16))
xtargparton: 	x of target parton (PARI(34))
beamparton: 	in case of resolved photon processes and soft VMD the virtual photon has a hadronic structure. This gives the info which parton interacted with the target parton (MSTI(15))
xbeamparton: 	x of beam parton (PARI(33))
thetabeamparton: 	theta of beam parton (PARI(53))
truey, trueQ2, truex, trueW2, trueNu: 	are the kinematic variables of the event.
	If radiative corrections are turned on they are different from what is calculated from the scattered lepton.
	If radiative corrections are turned off they are the same as what is calculated from the scattered lepton
	(In the current version radiative corrections are not implemented yet, so they should be the same from the scatterd lepton)
leptonphi:	phi of the lepton (VINT(313))
s_hat: 	shat of the process (PARI(14))
t_hat: 	Mandelstam t (PARI(15))
u_hat: 	Mandelstm u (PARI(16))
pt2_hat: 	pthat^2 of the hard scattering (PARI(18))
Q2_hat: 	Q2hat of the hard scattering (PARI(22)),
F2, F1, R, sigma_rad, SigRadCor: 	information used and needed in the radiative correction code
EBrems: 	energy of the radiative photon in the nuclear rest frame
photonflux: 	flux factor from PYTHIA (VINT(319))
nrTracks: 	number of tracks in this event, includes also virtual particles 

4th line: "============================================"
5th line: Information on track wise variables stored in the file 

I: 	line index, runs from 1 to nrTracks
ISTHKK(I): 	status code KS (1: stable particles 2: particles which might decay)
IDTHKK(I): 	particle KF code (211: pion, 2112:n, ....)
JMOHKK(1,I): 	line number of parent particle
JDAHKK(1,I): 	normally the line number of the first daughter.
JDAHKK(2,I): 	normally the line number of the last daughter.
PHKK(1,I): 	px of particle
PHKK(2,I): 	py of particle
PHKK(3,I): 	pz of particle
PHKK(4,I): 	Energy of particle
PHKK(5,I): 	mass of particle
VHKK(1,I): 	x vertex information
VHKK(2,I): 	y vertex information
VHKK(3,I): 	z vertex information

6th line: "============================================"
7th line: event information for first event
8th line: "============================================"
9th to X-1 line: trackwise info of 1st event
Xth line "=============== Event finished ===============" 

the information from line 7 to X repeats for each event.
