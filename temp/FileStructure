When running PYTHIA model, the event structure goes as follows:


The output file text format has the following structure:

1st line: "PYTHIA EVENT FILE"
2nd line: "============================================"
3rd line: Information on event wise variables stored in the file 

I: 	0 (line index)
ievent: 	eventnumber running from 1 to XXX
genevent: 	trials to generate this event
subprocess: 	pythia subprocess (MSTI(1)), for details see table above
nucleon: 	hadron beam type (MSTI(12))
targetparton: 	parton hit in the target (MSTI(16))
xtargparton: 	x of target parton (PARI(34))
beamparton: 	in case of resolved photon processes and soft VMD the virtual photon has a hadronic structure. This gives the info which parton interacted with the target parton (MSTI(15))
xbeamparton: 	x of beam parton (PARI(33))
thetabeamparton: 	theta of beam parton (PARI(53))
truey, trueQ2, truex, trueW2, trueNu: 	are the kinematic variables of the event.
	If radiative corrections are turned on they are different from what is calculated from the scattered lepton.
	If radiative corrections are turned off they are the same as what is calculated from the scattered lepton
	(In the current version radiative corrections are not implemented yet, so they should be the same from the scatterd lepton)
leptonphi:	phi of the lepton (VINT(313))
s_hat: 	shat of the process (PARI(14))
t_hat: 	Mandelstam t (PARI(15))
u_hat: 	Mandelstm u (PARI(16))
pt2_hat: 	pthat^2 of the hard scattering (PARI(18))
Q2_hat: 	Q2hat of the hard scattering (PARI(22)),
F2, F1, R, sigma_rad, SigRadCor: 	information used and needed in the radiative correction code
EBrems: 	energy of the radiative photon in the nuclear rest frame
photonflux: 	flux factor from PYTHIA (VINT(319))
b,Phib:		impact parameter of photon in TRF wrt nuclear center: 
                radial (in fm), azimuthal, z along gamma*, e' in x-z plane
Thickness:	nuclear thickness function T(b) in nucleons/fm2
ThickScl:	Scaled Nuclear thickness T(b)/rho_0 in units of fm
Ncollt:		Number of collisions between gamma* and nucleons in A
Ncolli:		Number of inelastic collisions between gamma* and nucleons in A
d1st:		density-weighted distance from first collision to edge of nucl.
davg:		Average density-weighted distance from all inelastic 
		collisions to edge of the nucleus
pxf,pyf,pzf:	Fermi-momentum of struck nucleon (or sum Fermi momentum for 
		all inelastic nucleon participants for Ncolli>1)
User1,2,3:	User variables to prevent/delay future format changes.
nrTracks: 	number of tracks in this event, including event history 

4th line: "============================================"

IDRES(I):	For a nucleus (IDHKK(I)=80000), this is A, else 0
IDXRES(I):	For a nucleus (IDHKK(I)=80000), this is Z, else 0
NOBAM(I):	Flag describing particle origin (0=INC & e'), 2=hard collision,
                3=evaporation/breakup products,4=final remnant nucleus
6th line: "============================================"
7th line: event information for first event
8th line: "============================================"
9th to X-1 line: trackwise info of 1st event
Xth line "=============== Event finished ===============" 

the information from line 7 to X repeats for each event.
